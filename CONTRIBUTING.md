## Hello, dear contributors!!!

You can contribute to RSS Guard project in a several different ways:

- by translating RSS Guard to some other languages (see [here](https://rssguard.readthedocs.io/en/stable/contrib/localization.html)),
- by submitting patches and pull requests (see [here](https://github.com/martinrotter/rssguard/pulls)),
- by donating some money to support and encourage developers (see **Sponsor** button on the top of this page).

### Donations
RSS Guard does not have dedicated forums or home website. It uses GitHub to host all its sources and other artifacts. The donations are only a way to show that you (as a user) really like RSS Guard and I do my job with it right.

Also, you can donate with particular goal. Maybe you want some very specific feature added? Maybe you want some specific bug fixed fast? In those cases, donation can speed things up.

But donations are of course NOT required at all. You do greater service to RSS Guard if you just use it. :)
