You can right-click any item in an embedded web browser and hit the `Save as` button. RSS Guard will then automatically display the downloader, and will download your file. This feature works in both RSS Guard [variants](#browseradblock). The downloader is also fully interconnected with some RSS Guard plugins, like Gmail where you can download e-mail attachments with it.
