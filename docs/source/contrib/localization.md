Localization
============
RSS Guard supports localization to [many languages](https://crowdin.com/project/rssguard).

If you are interested in translating RSS Guard, then go to [RSS Guard page on Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/project/rssguard) and check status of currently supported localizations.

```{warning}
All translators commit themselves to keep their translations up-to-date. If translation is not updated by the author regularly, and only a small number of strings is translated, then those translations along with their teams will eventually be REMOVED from the project!!! At least 50% of strings must be translated for translation to be added to project.
