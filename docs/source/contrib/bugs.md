Reporting Bugs or Feature Requests
==================================
Please report all issues/bugs/requests to [Issues page](https://github.com/martinrotter/rssguard/issues). Describe the problem you are having, and include steps taken to cause the issue to occur.

If you report a bug, you must provide the application debug log. Make sure to start RSS Guard from command line (`cmd.exe` on Windows) with `--log` switch and the path where you want to store the log file. For example, with this command: `rssguard.exe --log '.\rssguard.log'` the log file will be saved in a folder with RSS Guard's executable (`rssguard.exe`).

After starting RSS Guard this way, reproduce your issue and attach the log file to your ticket.

> Application log can also be displayed directly in RSS Guard (the `Help > Display application log` menu item).  
> Note that the log messages are pumped into dialog window only when it is opened (the window can be minimized).
